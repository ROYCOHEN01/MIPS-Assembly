In this project, I wrote code for a SIMP processor. The process starts with input instructions that I wrote in assembly language. These instructions are then passed to the assembler, which processes them by translating the assembly code into corresponding machine code and assigning the appropriate registers. Finally, the instructions are sent to the simulator (sim), which emulates the hardware and produces the desired outputs.
